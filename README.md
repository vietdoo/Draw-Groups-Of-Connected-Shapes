This program tackles the challenging task of grouping shapes in intersecting space and coloring them with a unified color. This problem is often encountered in various fields, such as graphic design, computer vision, and image processing.

The program's algorithm uses advanced techniques to detect overlapping shapes and identify their respective groups. Once the groups are established, the program assigns a unique color to each group and applies it to all the shapes within that group.

The program offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their shapes and visualize the grouping and coloring process in real-time. This feature enables users to make adjustments and fine-tune the results based on their preferences.

Furthermore, the program's versatility allows it to handle a wide range of shapes, from simple geometric shapes like circles and rectangles to complex irregular shapes. The program's accuracy and efficiency make it a valuable tool for designers, developers, and researchers who work with complex shapes and overlapping elements.

Overall, this program is a powerful tool for anyone who needs to group and color shapes in intersecting spaces quickly and accurately. Its user-friendly interface and advanced algorithm make it a top choice for designers, developers, and researchers in various fields.
